# PHYS220/MATH220/CPSC220 CW 13

**Author(s):** **Trevor Kling**

## Specification

**Becoming more familiar with $\LaTeX$**

In the `info` repository find the template directory for LaTeX. Copy the entire folder into this repository. Rename the latex source file (`.tex` extension) to `sombrero.tex`. Edit this file using the graphical editor in CoCalc - you should see a two-pane editing setup similar to the Markdown editor. This editor will automatically compile the LaTeX source to a pdf file. (You will see many new files created in the same directory as the source from this compilation process.) Following the ideas of the template, write a brief document (1-2 pages) that reports on the problem from CW12, as well as its solution. Be sure to use sections properly, as well as both inline and displayed equations with numbers. Choose a few figures that you created in your notebook, export them to `.png` files and include them as figures in the latex document with appropriate captions. Treat this document as a professional report that you are planning to give a colleague to explain to them the problem and how you solved it. When you are satisfied with your document, and it compiles properly to pdf, commit *only* the `.tex` file, the supporting `.png` image files, and the `.pdf` file to GitHub.

*Hint:* If you need help learning $\LaTeX$, look at the links in the `info` repository. Note that in the Markdown documents for the README files any code between dollar signs is in fact $\LaTeX$ mathmode code. Also note that an excellent free web-based collaborative editor for $\LaTeX$ documents is [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com), which is a solid alternative to the editor provided within CoCalc. If you wrote up your notebook well in CW12, you should be able to adapt most of the text and equations with minimal effort by copy-pasting them into the correct spots within the latex file.
  
## Assessment

As I already use $\LaTeX$ quite frequently, most parts of this assignment were familiar territory.  Observing the effect of a different basic package than my usual setup was quite interesing, however.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
